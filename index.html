    <p>We found Jill with her brother, Jack, in an animal shelter. She lived a happy life and passed away earlier this year. She was a great dog who loved to sniff.
      She'd sit at the door and just sniff whatever smells come under it all night.

    <p>Nessie is undoubtedly my dog. She's a border collie, and decided I was the sole member of her herd to follow and protect. I'm not around much anymore,
      so she tends to just make sure Seamus isn't getting in trouble.

    <p>Seamus is a big golden retriever. He's still a puppy, and loves to play, chew, and swim. He's a lot bigger now than he was in the picture.</p>
