  <p>Today we're going to be talking about three important orbital properties that can tell you almost everything about an orbit!</p>
<ol>
  <section>
    <h2><li>The two apsides, apoapsis and periapsis</li></h2>

    <p>
      The apsides are the two farthest points of any orbit. The apoapsis is the highest point, leaving the periapsis to be the lowest. In a perfect circular
      orbit, both apsides will be the same. Pretty simple, right?

    <h2><li>Eccentricity</li></h2>

    <p>
      Eccentricity is a property that describes how much an object in orbit deviates from a perfect, circular orbit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A circular orbit has an eccentricity of 0.</li>
      <li>A non-circular elliptical orbit has an eccentricity between 0 and 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we're specifically talking about orbits and not trajectories, eccentricity can be applied to more than ellipses.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A parabolic trajectory has an eccentricity of 1.</li>
      <li>A hyperbolic trajectory has an eccentricity greater than 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><li>Inclination</li></h2>
    <figure class="fig">
      <img src="images/inclination.jpg"/>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Inclination is, simply put, the tilt of an orbit. It's usually given in degrees, and if it's a satellite orbiting a planet, the reference tilt is
      usually the planet's equator. The inclination can also tell you the rotation of the object in the orbit.
      <br></br>
      Inclinations between 0 degrees and 90 degrees are in a prograde orbit (they go around the orbit the same direction the planet rotates), while an inclination
      between 90 degrees and 180 degrees are in a retrograde orbit (the opposite of a prograde orbit). An inclination of 0 degrees means the satellite is in a prograde
      orbit going the same way as the planets rotation. An inclination of 90 degrees is a polar orbit (imagine an orbit that is in line with the top and bottom
      of the planet). An inclination of 180 degrees is an equitorial retrograde orbit.
